Reading and writing Well Known Text (WKT) and Well Known Binary (WKB) based on [GeoInterface.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeo/GeoInterface.jl/). See [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) for an explanation of Well-known text and binary geometry.
